# Postmortem

From Ethan's perspective.

Processes that went well:

+ Brainstormed simple games with estimates. Agreed on gameplay by 7 pm.
+ Communicated schedule to integrate art and music.
+ Quickly integrated music and art.

Processes that didn't go well:

- The first player noticed an empty hallway, and said the controls were too jumpy.
- I blocked feedback on level design and audio while programming complicated function to pool blocks in looping levels.
- Profiling and optimizing cube models took a few iterations. The first round of tests seemed to have a fast frame rate, then the next round had a slow frame rate.

Next time, I might also:

+ Schedule a 1-minute playtest at 3 pm on Saturday with most complex placeholder assets.
+ Build the minimum for that minute.
+ Code a complex function later from simple sub-functions coded earlier.
